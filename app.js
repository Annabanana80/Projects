//Planning phase:
//Should create an onload function
//Should declare a variable for an array for all cards. Will download images of cards.
//Should generate cards by grabbing element by the id when the button is clicked. Should loop over the array to shuffle to cards.
//The cards should fall randomly onto the page.
//Cards should be clickable and should go into a pile *or* can disappear from the table
//When the button is clicked, the timer should start AND the cards will be thrown onto the table.

//TL/DR: When the button is clicked the following should happen:
	//Cards are generated and thrown randomly onto the page
	//The timer starts counting download
//To win, the player must click and pick up all of the cards before the timer hits 00:00:00.
