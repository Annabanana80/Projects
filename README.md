52 Card Pick Up MVP
User Stories:

This game should...
1. With the click of a button, shuffle the cards and throw them down on the page in set, random-looking positions.
2. The player should be able to click the cards and the cards will go into a pile once clicked.
3. There will be a timer that counts down.
4. Text will show on the screen at different times saying goofy things to the player. 


Stretch goals:

1. The player will need to pick up the cards in order.
	a. The cards will either have to be one down or up or the same number/face/ace.
2. There will be three timers in place for the player to click on; easy, medium, and sadistic.
3. Make the background a very obnoxious late 80's/early 90's theme with neon colors, triangles, squiggly lines, etc.
4. Cards will fall randomly each time and in a different place/position.----priority

Languages needed:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

With the languages I will need to:

1. Use DOM manipulation in conjunction with loops to generate the cards
2. Use advanced (to me anyway) CSS to animate the cards
3. Either Vanilla JS or jQuery--depending on my mood.
4. Click events.
5. Alerts
6. A responsive page using HTML and CSS.
7. Fun colors! Possibly a backdrop that will remind you of the show "Saved by the Bell"
